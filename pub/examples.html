   <h3>
      These are visualizations of two basketball halfcourts. The basket is at the top and the center circle is at the bottom of each visualization.
   </h3>
   <h3>
      Each visualization has its own set of data.
      The different coloured points represent different types of actions like shot makes, misses, rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, and fouls
   </h3>
   <h3>
      The sliders below each of the courts can be used to update the visualization by hiding or showing the different actions in the order that they are in the dataset.
      For example, dragging the slider forward from the start will add the first action, then the second, third, fourth and so on, to the visualization.
